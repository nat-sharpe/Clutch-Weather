A mobile-first web app built with React for Clutch Technologies. 

Fetches current conditions and a three day forecast from Yahoo's weather API. The user can search for any location in the United States and add/delete it in their list. They can also toggle between the forecast and today's weather, and use arrows to cycle through all locations. The entire list is saved in local storage.

Bootstrapped with create-react-app:
To view the development build use 'npm start'
To view the production build use 'npm run build' and then 'serve -s build'
