Here at Clutch, we have a number of employees who love outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and playing sports. Unfortunately, Atlanta's weather can be a bit sporadic, so its always good for us to know what the next few days' weather looks like!

We would like you to use the Yahoo weather API to build a simple web application that shows us the current weather, as well as the forecast for the next 3 days for multiple locations of our choosing. We want to be able to add a new location (using something like zip code, city, etc.), toggle between weather information for a selected location, and remove a location from the application.

Our web applications are built around React and Redux, but you can use any front end framework you'd like or no framework at all if you prefer. The tech stack you choose is up to you. We'd love for you to provide the application code, as well as some instructions for how to run it, in a code repository (Github, GitLab, etc.) that we can clone and run on our machines.

Bonus: We'd be really excited if the site was responsive for mobile and it would be awesome if the weather locations didn't have to be re-added when we leave and return to the page on our device.

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app. run thecreate a production build, use npm run build.
